# A Beginner's Guide to Customizing Mastodon

## Introduction/Disclaimer

**This guide has no connection to the [official Mastodon project](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon ).** It is the product of my personal attempts to hack together modifications for my own instance, and an attempt to help other people who want to modify *their* instance avoid the pain and suffering I have gone through to gather this knowledge.

Additionally, while this is titled A Beginner's Guide, I will be making some baseline assumptions about the reader's abilities and previous knowledge. Those assumptions are:

- An understanding of general programming concepts and terminology.
- A familiarity with installing, updating, and running a Mastodon instance as a system administrator.
- Familiarity with basic git commands or knowledge of how to look them up on the internet.

If you don't know React.js or Ruby on Rails, you're fine. (Honestly, I don't either.)
